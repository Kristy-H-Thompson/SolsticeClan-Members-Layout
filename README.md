# SolsticeClan Members Layout
This project was a collaborative commission for a jcink roleplaying website, Sinister Haven. This project uses google sheets as a database to store character information, which is then displayed on the clan's member page. Site members submit their characters through the a form located on the clan page. New characters will show up on the clan page as pending until the clan leader reviews the submission, and changes the characters status to "accepted" on the spreadsheet.

## Project Features
*Character database: character information is stored in google sheets instead of directly in the html<br>
*Character archive: characters can be removed from being displayed on the page, without being deleted to preserve character descriptions. Site members can re-add their characters from the archive onto the clan page without help of a staff member in the archive tab on the clan members page.<br>
*Joining form: site members can add characters to the clan by submitting a form on the clan member's page. Character information is sent directly to the spreadsheet.<br>
*Blood type calculator: each character on the site is assigned a bloodtype when joining based on a random number generator and their parent's bloodtype<br>
*Pending characters: new characters show up as pending until approved by a clan leader<br>
*Character sorting: characters on the member page can be sorted alphabetically, by username, and more<br>
*Character views:site members can view the clan's characters in gallery or allegiences format<br>
*Clan statistics:iframes are used in the clan statistics tab to display clan statistics that will automatically update as characters are added and deleted<br>
*Email notifications:email notifications to clan leaders when there are pending characters waiting for approval on the spreadsheet

## Project Goals
*Make adding/editing characters to the clan member's page easier for site staff members unfamiliar with coding<br>
*Incorperate statistics about the clan's members onto the page<br>
*Create a system for removing inactive characters from the page, without loosing their descriptions<br>
*Allow site members to add their characters to the clan without having to contact a staff member<br>
